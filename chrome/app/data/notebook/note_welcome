WELCOME TO TAKENOTE – TOUCH EDITION
 
Thank you for purchasing TakeNote, the easy note manager for Kindle Touch devices!
 
TakeNote is designed to be an easy and intuitive way to take notes on your Kindle device. TakeNote has a simple user interface that does not get in your way. It is designed to take full advantage of your Kindle’s touch interface, allowing you to interact directly with objects on the screen.

This note provides you with quick hints for using TakeNote.  Please see the Help screen for more details.

To get started, tap on the New Note icon (at the right side of the TakeNote toolbar) to create a note.

QUICK TIPS

Main Screen

-> Notes are displayed in reverse chronological order, starting from the one that was created or edited last.
-> The Title bar shows the name of the current Notebook.  You can create as many Notebooks are you want.
-> Tap a note in the list to open it in the editor.
-> Long-tap on a note to get options to delete or copy it.
-> Create additional Notebooks by using the Menu -> Switch To Another Notebook option.

Note Editor

-> Up to 50 edit actions can be undone.  The Redo action lets you put back changes that were undone.
-> Save your changes and continue editing by using the Menu -> Save and Continue Editing option.
-> Use any note as a template for new notes.  Open the note and tap the Save As icon.
-> If you close TakeNote while editing a note (e.g. by pressing the Home button or tapping the Back or Shopping Cart icons), TakeNote remembers where you were.  The next time you run TakeNote, it will take you right back to the note you were editing.
